## Abstract
In this project, I build a web application to regconize over 130 kinds of food using **Computer Vision** and **Transfer Learning** with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/). This is an extended implementation of this original paper [Food-101](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) (which only regconize 101 kinds of food) by combining the [Food-101 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) and [30VNFoods dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/quandang/vietnamese-foods) (which contains 30 kinds of Vietnamese foods). The final model (application) is able to regconize 131 different kinds of foods in total, especially some of the authentic Vietnamese foods (such as phở, gỏi cuốn, bánh bèo, bánh mì, hủ tiếu, bánh xèo, etc). The fine-tuned model has the top accuracy of **84.4%** across all categories.

The app can be access via [this link](https://share.streamlit.io/luongtruong77/food_130_recognition/main/app.py)

## Data
In this project, I will use 2 datasets to train my model:

**The Food-101 Data Set**

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/774bab4e061d5f840d283908b694449d1c7588e60740057e0086f721e4c8c416/68747470733a2f2f646174612e766973696f6e2e65652e6574687a2e63682f63766c2f64617461736574735f65787472612f666f6f642d3130312f7374617469632f696d672f666f6f642d3130312e6a7067)

This challenging data set has 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels.

**The 30VNFoods Data Set**

![](https://github.com/luongtruong77/food_130_recognition/raw/main/figures/banh_mi.jpg?raw=true)

This dataset has 30 Vietnamese food categories, collected by Quan Dang, and available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/quandang/vietnamese-foods). It has the most authentic Vietnamese food categories, and is good for this purpose of building this app. Since pho is in both datasets, the combined dataset has 130 categories (instead of 131).

The combined dataset has the total of 93725 images for training and 30086 images for testing, belonging to 130 classes.

## Algorithms

### 1. Transfer Learning

#### What is transfer learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where we use a pre-trained model on one task to re-used on another related task. In other words, taking the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and using them for our own problem.

```
Transfer learning and domain adaptation refer to the situation where what has been learned in one setting … is exploited to improve generalization in another setting
```

There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:
- Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.
- Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has already learned patterns on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data.

#### How do we use transfer learning in this project?
In this particular project, I will use the pre-trained [EfficientNet-B4 Architecture](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/b4/feature-vector/1) to extract features from it, then fine tune on top few hundreds layers of the entire architecture to get the final model.
EfficientNets are a family of image classification models, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, yet being an order-of-magnitude smaller and faster than previous models. As of the time this article is written, EffiecientNet is the best architecture using for food classification. Here is the original paper and its authors:
- Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le: [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), ICML 2019.

### 2. Feature Extraction and Fine-Tuning

#### Feature extraction
Feature extraction transfer learning is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) a pretrained model has learned and adjust its outputs to be more suited to your problem.

For example, say the pretrained model I am using has 448 different layers (EfficientNetB4 has 448 layers), but the top layer outputs 1000 classes because it was pretrained on [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/). To adjust this to my own problem, I might want to remove the original activation layer and replace it with my own but with the right number of output classes (in this case, 130 instead of 1000). The important part here is that only the top few layers become trainable, the rest remain frozen. This way all the underlying patterns remain in the rest of the layers and I can utilize them for my own problem. This kind of transfer learning is very helpful when my data is similar to the data a model has been pretrained on.

![](\images\food-131-app\feature-extraction.png)

Just after the first 5 epochs with the EfficientNetB4 base model, we have the accuracy of **72.7%** on the entire test data. Obviously, we can totally do better by fine-tuning the model. So, how do we do it? Let's deep dive into what fine-tuning is and how to leverage it!

#### Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning transfer learning is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) of a pretrained model and adjust (fine-tune) them to your own problem.

This usually means training **some, many or all** of the layers in the pretrained model. This is useful when I've got a large dataset (e.g. 100+ images per class) where my data is slightly different to the data the original model was trained on. In this case, the combined dataset has roughly 750 images for training and 250 images for testing, so I will **unfreeze** the top 248 layers of EffiencientNetB4 and leave the rest 200 layers frozen for underlying features.

- Let's create more **callbacks** to track our progress:
    - **EarlyStopping:** when the training process does not improve the result, stop the training
    - **ModelCheckpoint:** save the best model
    - **ReduceLROnPlateau:** when the process does not improve the result, reduce the learning rate for the gradient descent to converse more easily

### 3. Results

![](\images\food-131-app\final-result.png)

After running for a few more epochs, we have the accuracy of **82.6%** on the test set and the training process stopped. Let's reduce the learning rate to **2e^-5** and run a few more epochs to see if the results improves.

![](\images\food-131-app\fine-tune-2.png)

![](\images\food-131-app\fine-tune-3.png)

We now have the accuracy of **84.4%**, very good for our model. For higher accuracy, we could reduce the learning rate and run for more epochs, which what I would do very soon. However, for the demonstration purpose, I will stop at this stage and test my model on unseen food images.

### 4. Test the model on unseen data

![](\images\food-131-app\pred-1.png)

In this image, the model successfully predicts **steak** with the high confidence of **84.45%** and gets confused with **bánh tét (12.74%)**.**Bánh tét** is one the most famous food (or cake) of Vietnamese people during Lunar New Year. If you're interested in what that is, this [Google link](https://www.google.com/search?q=b%C3%A1nh_t%C3%A9t) might show some of the images of **bánh tét**.

![](\images\food-131-app\pred-2.png)

![](\images\food-131-app\pred-3.png)

![](\images\food-131-app\pred-4.png)

In the 3 predictions above, the model successfully predicts the right labels for all images. In case if anyone wonders what **bún đậu mắm tôm** is, it's one of my favorite authentic Vietnamese foods. It's originally from Northern Vietnam and it has gained its popularity in the South in the past couple of years. There are few places that are serving **bún đậu mắm tôm** in Seattle and surrounding areas. I am hungry now!

### 5. Deployment

I build the simple streamlit app that takes images from your device or take live picture from your device's camera and spits out its prediction under 10 seconds. Please try out the app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/luongtruong77/food_130_recognition/main/app.py) when you go out to eat, or before you upload your food photo into instagram.
